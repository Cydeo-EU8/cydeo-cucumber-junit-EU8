Gherkin Language
Given --> is used for precondition
        user is on the home page
        user is a frequent flier
        user is log in as instructor

When/And ---> steps/actions
        user enters email
        user searches for bla bla ..

Then ----> verification steps
        user should see search results
        the meeting should be scheduled

DryRun = true/ false : true-- not running the test actually just getting snippets

Tags: to run specific scenario or scenarios
@dice or @test : all the scenarios with @dice or @test tags will run
@dice and @smoke : both tags have to be there
@regression and not @dice

Parameterized step definitions

TestNG vs
Assert.assertEquals(actual,expected,"message")
Junit
Assert.assertEquals("message",expected,actual)

Background Cucumber Framework
If you have same precondition for scenarios in the SAME Feature File

Scenario Outline in Cucumber BDD Framework

I use Scenario Outline to perform Data Driven Testing

How to run failed test cases again?
1. Class Recordings:
    - we use reun plugin to create rerun.txt file
    - we use failedtestrunner class to run only those scenarios that are failed

2. mvn commands
mvn -Dsurefire.rerunFailingTestsCount=1 test
our failed test scenarios will run one more time

* Parallel Testing
What do we need for parallel tests?
- Driver Class needs to be changed to driverpool
- you need to have mavensurefire plugin in your pom.xml, to be able to run Maven lifecycle commands
- in Cucumber framework we run features in parallel way
- add to your pom.xml: configure the plug-in
 <configuration>
                    <parallel>methods</parallel>

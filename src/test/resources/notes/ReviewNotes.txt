Gherkin Language
Given --> is used for precondition
        user is on the home page
        user is a frequent flier
        user is log in as instructor

When/And ---> steps/actions
        user enters email
        user searches for bla bla ..

Then ----> verification steps
        user should see search results
        the meeting should be scheduled

DryRun = true/ false : true-- not running the test actually just getting snippets

Tags: to run specific scenario or scenarios
@dice or @test : all the scenarios with @dice or @test tags will run
@dice and @smoke : both tags have to be there
@regression and not @dice

Parameterized step definitions

TestNG vs
Assert.assertEquals(actual,expected,"message")
Junit
Assert.assertEquals("message",expected,actual)

Background Cucumber Framework
If you have same precondition for scenarios in the SAME Feature File

Scenario Outline in Cucumber BDD Framework

I use Scenario Outline to perform Data Driven Testing

Data Driven TEsting: Testing functionality of the application using multiple sets of data/input/parameters
